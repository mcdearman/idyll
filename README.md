# miniML

The official implementation of the miniML programming language

## Goals

- Pure functional programming
- Static types
- Row polymorphism
- Algebraic effects and monads (with the ability to convert between the two)
- Lisp-like macros on token trees
- Optional indentation sensitivity
- Lazy evaluation by default
- VM runtime
- Fast compile times
- Performance achieved with JIT
- JIT compiled strict hotpaths
- JIT compiled safe mutation with Rc (perceus)
- Tunable compiler and runtime
- Interactive programming
- Omniscient debugging
- IDE with multiple views of the code
- Platform-independent distributable low-level IR
- Visual programming
- Aspect-oriented programming with decorators/attributes
- Runtime monitoring and reflection
