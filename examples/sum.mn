-- sum types are just tagged unions
type Shape = Circle | Rectangle | Triangle

-- this is equivalent to
record Circle
record Rectangle
record Triangle

-- and the type of the Shape type is
union Shape = Circle | Rectangle | Triangle

-- here's another with a parameter
type Option T = Some T | None

-- this is equivalent to
record Some T = T
record None

-- and the type of the Option type is
union Option T = Some T | None
